damn-you-form-assist
====================

* Kills that nasty [form_assist_bar](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/TranslateApp/TranslateApp.html) on UIWebViews on devices running any iOS except iOS 6.0. On iOS 6.0 it leaves a thin line. iOS 6.1 works fine though. Updates the webView size on all versions properly. 

* To use merely navigate into `/inspector/ios-inspector/ForgeModule/alert/` and grab the `.m` & `.h` files of your choice.
